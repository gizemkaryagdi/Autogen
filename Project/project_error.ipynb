Your expertise is proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular or Vue.js, as well as knowledge of build tools such as Webpack, Babel and version control systems such as Git. Additionally, your knowledge of user interface design brings you the ability to translate existing UI/UX design wireframes into actual code, and you work closely with designers to ensure the final product is both visually appealing and functional. Your forte is using best practices to ensure web applications are fast, responsive and efficient. This means you optimize code, images, and other assets to improve loading times and overall performance. This includes extensive testing and debugging to ensure web applications run smoothly across different browsers and devices.

Review the list of buttons provided in Step 1 and identify the HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<a>`, etc.) and any relevant context information.\\n2. For each button, I\\'ll add an `aria-label` or `title` attribute to provide a descriptive text that screen readers can read aloud. This will ensure that visually impaired users can understand the purpose of each button.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how I might implement this step:\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- Original code -->\\n<button>Submit Form</button>\\n\\n<!-- Updated code with accessible name -->\\n<button aria-label=\"Submit Form\">Submit Form</button>\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, if the button is an `<a>` element, I might use the `title` attribute instead:\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- Original code -->\\n<a href=\"#\">Download PDF</a>\\n\\n<!-- Updated code with accessible name -->\\n<a href=\"#\" title=\"Download PDF\">Download PDF</a>\\n```\\n\\n3. Ensure that the accessible names are concise, clear, and accurately describe the button\\'s purpose.\\n4. Use the same format for all buttons to maintain consistency throughout the website or application.\\n\\nBy following these steps, I\\'ll ensure that each button has an accessible name that can be read aloud by screen readers, improving the overall accessibility of the website or application.', 'name': 'Engineer', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\\nCode output: Code saved to /Users/gizemkaryagdi/Desktop/Masaüstü /Autogen/Autogen/Project/coding/Original code\\nCode saved to /Users/gizemkaryagdi/Desktop/Masaüstü /Autogen/Autogen/Project/coding/Original code\\n', 'name': 'code_executor', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'I\\'d be happy to evaluate your Python code.
